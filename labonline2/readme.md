Had to use a lot of names since I was constrained to using only dictionaries, the fact i haven't noted somehow until the very last moment, so I researched implementation of 'lambdas' in Python. Turned out to be a pretty easy thing to do.

Using json to store dictionaries was also a walk in the park, given the fact the the whole process uses three functions.

I still think the solution with some usage of classes would be much more elegant. A lot of long and repetitive code could be avoided.
