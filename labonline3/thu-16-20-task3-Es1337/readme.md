During this exercise I had the opportunity to learn unittest, which I haven't used before. Writing tests for another person's code 
meant that I had to comprehend what was their idea for the module, which i enjoyed since I don't get to have that kind of interaction with 
other people's code very often. I learnt a lot of incredibly useful things during the exercise.
